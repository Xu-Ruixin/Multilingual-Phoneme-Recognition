# Multilingual-Phoneme-Recognition
This is the project I did of the course Speech Recognition D. I have completed character-level Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and phoneme-level ASR experiments for Czech to Czech, Czech to Finnish, and Czech to Norwegian, encompassing the entire process from data preprocessing, model training to performance evaluation.
